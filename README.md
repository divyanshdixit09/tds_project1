1. Explanation of data scraping
First, I extracted all the users in the city of Tokyo with over 200 followers from the endpoint https://api.github.com/search/users . Since the response can only contain upto 100 results per page so we had to iterate each page of the response.

The query made to the endpoint was q=type:user+location:Tokyo+followers:>200&per_page=100&page={page} wher page was a number iterable to iterate each page of response. All the response pages are written to tokyo.txt which was later converted to tokyo.json after some cleaning and modification.

Now, we iterate over the json objects in the items property of tokyo.json and use the login property value in the endpoint https://api.github.com/users/{login} which gives the details about the user like login, name, company, location, email, hireable, bio, public_repos, followers, following, created_at.

Similarly for fetching information upto 500 most recently pushed repositories for each user we make use the endpoint https://api.github.com/users/{login}/repos with the query:

sort=pushed&per_page=100&page={page} where page is again an iterable since all the results won't come in a single page. This gives us details about each repository of the user like login, full_name, created_at, stargazers_count, watches_count, language, has_projects, has_wiki, license_name.

2. Interesting fact:

The most interesting fact I found out after analyzing the data using the GitHub API was the performance of the API, if it were not for the rate limit the data acquisition from the api is quite fast for such a large amount of data, it were able to give me info of upto 500 repositories of 592 users in Tokyo in a matter of few minutes which were 66463 recors in total.

Surprisingly, hireable users tend to follow significantly fewer people than non-hireable users, suggesting a potential trend in networking behavior.

3. Actionable Recommendation:

The use of personal access token (PAT) or fine-grained tokens are of great use in using GitHub API since it increases your rate limit and also ensures security by allowing you to set it's permissions.

Developers should keep their bios concise but meaningful, as even slight increases in bio length show a small positive correlation with follower count.
